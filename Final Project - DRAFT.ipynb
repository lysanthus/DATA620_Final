    "### Introduction\n",
    "The website www.politifact.com is a non-partisan fact-checking website that dedicates itself to countering false and misleading political information $^1$. Politifact uses human fact-checkers to research statements made by politicians or viral media that states a political viewpoint. The fact-checker (also known as a \"curtor\") assigns a score for the item: True, Mostly True, Half True, Mostly False, False, and the dreaded \"Pants On Fire\" for the biggest falsehoods. The specifics of their research are also included to provide detail and sources related to their scoring."

    "The goal of this analysis is to use NLP techniques on the curator's review to categorize the topics of the record (e.g. budget, coronavirus, election, etc.). Once topics have been assigned to each record, a network analysis of sources will be done to analyze patterns of false information by topic (e.g. politician X frequently puts out more misleading/false information on topic Y than any other)."
